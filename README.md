This project implements a real-time bus tracking system using embedded C++ and microcontroller platforms such as NodeMCU. It integrates GPS modules and transmits location data over serial or network interfaces, potentially to a server via XAMPP or similar environments.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time location tracking of buses.
- GPS module integration to fetch latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Data transmission via Wi-Fi or serial communication.
- Compatible with NodeMCU or similar ESP-based microcontroller boards.
- Modular `.ino` files for testing different functionalities (`gps`, `lat_lon`, `xampp`, etc.).

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Platform:** Embedded (Arduino/NodeMCU/ESP8266)
- **Modules & Libraries:** Likely includes GPS, SoftwareSerial, WiFi, and HTTP client libraries (refer to code for exact dependencies)

## ⚙️ Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bus_tracking.git
cd bus_tracking
```

### 2. Open the Sketch

Open the desired `.ino` file (e.g., `Bus_tracking.ino`, or from subdirectories like `nodemcu_xampp`) using the **Arduino IDE** or another compatible development environment.

### 3. Setup the Arduino IDE

- Install the required **board support package** for NodeMCU/ESP8266.
- Go to **Tools > Board > Board Manager** and search for *ESP8266*.
- Install the corresponding libraries listed at the top of the sketch files:
  - GPS modules (e.g., `TinyGPS++`, `SoftwareSerial`)
  - WiFi or HTTP client libraries (e.g., `ESP8266WiFi`, `ESP8266HTTPClient`)

### 4. Connect Your Hardware

- Connect your **GPS module** to the correct pins (refer to sketch comments).
- Ensure **NodeMCU/ESP board** is properly connected via USB.

### 5. Select Board and Port

- Tools > Board: Select your ESP8266 board (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0)
- Tools > Port: Select the correct COM port

### 6. Upload the Code

Click **Upload** in the Arduino IDE to flash the microcontroller with the selected `.ino` sketch.

## 🚀 Usage

After uploading the code:

1. The microcontroller will initialize and begin reading GPS coordinates.
2. The data may be:
   - Printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging
   - Sent to a remote server via HTTP (XAMPP or other) depending on the sketch used
3. Use a web app or serial terminal to visualize or log the bus location.
